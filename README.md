# Cyber-Bully-Tweet-Classifier-Using-AI
With the increasing prevalence of cyberbullying on social media platforms, automated detection systems are becoming essential for identifying and addressing harmful content. This study focuses on the development of an AI model (Cyber-Bully-Tweet-Classifier), which utilizes various machine learning algorithms to classify tweets based on their association with different types of cyberbullying. The dataset includes tweets labeled by cyberbullying type, such as gender, religion, age, and ethnicity. Text preprocessing techniques, including emoji removal, URL extraction, lemmatization, and stopword elimination, are applied to cleanse the data. Additionally, n-gram analysis is used to identify frequently occurring word pairs and single words across different categories of cyberbullying. 

The classifier uses the TF-IDF vectorization technique to transform text into numerical features, followed by the application of several machine learning models, including Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. The performance of these models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. The results demonstrate that the classifiers are capable of accurately identifying cyberbullying in tweets, with Random Forest and Logistic Regression performing notably well. This classifier has the potential to be integrated into social media platforms for real-time detection of cyberbullying, contributing to a safer online environment.
